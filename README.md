# Pi Club Website Demo

This is a color demo for the BTC Raspberry Pi Club website.

## Setup

Important: You mush have [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download), [git](https://git-scm.com/), and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed.

To run the site on your own computer:

Use a terminal to `cd` to the directory you want the project to be in:

```sh
cd ~/websites/
```

Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Agent-E11/piclub-website-demo.git
```

`cd` into the project and install the dependencies

```sh
cd ./piclub-website-demo
npm install
```

Open the project in VS Code and run the live server (if you don't have live-server installed, you can install it from the extensions tab)

```sh
code .
```

```txt
(now in VS Code)

Ctrl+Shift+P
Live Server: Open with live server
```

You now have the website open in a web browser, and any changes you make will immediately be reflected in the website
